# Talentica_assignment_OCR
A Python-based OCR-powered invoice parser that extracts structured data into JSON format and enables intelligent querying using LLM model.



# 🧾 AI-Powered Invoice Parser with OCR, EasyOCR, and Groq Integration

This project is a lightweight AI-powered invoice parser built with **Flask**, **EasyOCR**, **Mindee API**, and **Groq (LLaMA model)**. It allows you to upload an invoice image, extract structured JSON data using OCR, and interactively query that data using a GPT-style model via Groq.

## 📌 Features

- Upload image-based invoices (supports PNG, JPG, JPEG, PDF, BMP, TIFF, etc.)
- Extract structured invoice data using **EasyOCR**
- JSON output is saved for each uploaded invoice
- Ask natural language questions on the invoice using **Groq's LLaMA model**
- Simple and intuitive **Flask** web UI
